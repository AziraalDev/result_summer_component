## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

- It was quite interesting to work with various border styles and colors.
- I've learned how to dynamically add information from a JSON file directly to the DOM. (It is also possible to change SVGs to images and load them from JSON.)
- I've gained a better understanding of variables, though there are still many aspects to explore before moving on to SASS.

### Continued Development

- In my next steps, I plan to focus on creating a web app that is 100% identical to the design, ensuring that all necessary steps are completed.
